# [Unity](https://unity.com/) Prototype

When creating tutorials or prototypes it may be useful to start from a template.

## Project Description:

This is a template for Unity projects. Instead of creating a project in the inspector clone this repository and open it in unity.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are useful for describing what a project is about and gifs can also be used.

## GitIgnore

Some files/folders are ignored by git, check the .gitignore file. I do not recommend you ignore files by default. 

I often use this folder for proprietary assets that I do not have the rights to share.
